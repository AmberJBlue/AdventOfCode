# Mull It Over: Day 3

## üéÑ Introduction
At the **North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop**, the shopkeeper is having computer troubles. The Historians are busy searching the warehouse for any sign of the Chief Historian, leaving you to figure out why the computer is malfunctioning.

The computer's memory (your puzzle input) is corrupted, with valid instructions mixed in with junk data. Your task is to **scan the corrupted memory, identify valid multiplication instructions, and sum up the results of their calculations**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Problem Overview

### Valid Instructions:
A valid instruction follows the format:

```plaintext
mul(X,Y)
```
Where:
- `mul` is the command.
- `X` and `Y` are integers (1 to 3 digits each).
- Parentheses and commas must be properly formatted without extra spaces.

### Invalid Instructions:
Corrupted data contains invalid characters or malformed instructions, such as:
- **Extra characters**: `xmul(2,4)%&`
- **Missing commas**: `mul(32,64]`
- **Invalid parentheses**: `mul(6,9!`
- **Spaces within the instruction**: `mul ( 2 , 4 )`

### Example Input:
```plaintext
xmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))
```

### Example Analysis:
From the input above:
- Valid `mul` instructions:
  - `mul(2,4)` ‚Üí Result: `2 * 4 = 8`
  - `mul(3,7)` ‚Üí Result: `3 * 7 = 21`
  - `mul(11,8)` ‚Üí Result: `11 * 8 = 88`
  - `mul(8,5)` ‚Üí Result: `8 * 5 = 40`
- Sum of results: `8 + 21 + 88 + 40 = 161`

## üõ†Ô∏è Your Task

### Input:
- A single string of corrupted memory data.

### Output:
- The sum of the results of all valid `mul` instructions.

---

## üîç Steps to Solve
1. **Extract Valid `mul` Instructions**:
   - Use a regular expression to identify instructions matching the format `mul(X,Y)`.
   - Ensure `X` and `Y` are integers with 1 to 3 digits.

2. **Calculate Results**:
   - For each valid instruction, parse the integers `X` and `Y` and calculate `X * Y`.

3. **Sum the Results**:
   - Add up the results of all valid `mul` instructions.

---

### Example Code (Python)
```python
import re

def sum_valid_muls(corrupted_memory):
    # Regular expression for valid mul instructions
    pattern = r"mul\((\d{1,3}),(\d{1,3})\)"
    
    # Find all matches in the corrupted memory
    matches = re.findall(pattern, corrupted_memory)
    
    # Calculate and sum results
    total = sum(int(x) * int(y) for x, y in matches)
    
    return total

# Example Input
corrupted_memory = "xmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))"

# Total Sum of Valid Multiplications
print(sum_valid_muls(corrupted_memory))  # Output: 161
```
