# Advent of Code Solutions 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions for the coding challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024), a series of fun and challenging programming puzzles released daily in December.

## 📜 About Advent of Code
**Advent of Code (AoC)** is an annual event where programmers worldwide participate in solving creative puzzles that blend storytelling, logic, and programming. Each day from December 1st to 25th, a new two-part puzzle is unlocked at midnight EST. 

These puzzles are designed to be:
- **Challenging:** A great way to hone your algorithmic and problem-solving skills.
- **Fun:** Each puzzle is wrapped in a festive holiday-themed story.
- **Accessible:** Suitable for beginners and experts alike, with increasing difficulty as the event progresses.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```plaintext
